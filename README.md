Note: Creating step charts requires a Google login.

This project is a small web tool to help create step patterns for dance games
(Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, StepManiaX). I'm mostly using it to
personally make quick notes and practice certain parts of songs. Hope others may
find it useful. üê∏
